# Arch Linux Website

This is a remake of the [Arch Linux website](https://archlinux.org/){:target="_blank"} made for a school project.

Had to use canvas in the dowload section but that can easly be replaced with a SVG.

## Important:

Only **Home** and **Download** pages work!

**DO NOT EXECUTE COMMANDS FOUND IN THE NEWS SECTION!**
